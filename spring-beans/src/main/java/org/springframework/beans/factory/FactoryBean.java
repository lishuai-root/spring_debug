/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects. If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 *
 * 接口由{@link BeanFactory}中使用的对象实现，这些对象本身就是[[单个]]对象的工厂。
 * 如果一个bean实现了这个接口，它将被用作对象公开的工厂，而不是直接作为将自己公开的bean实例。
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 *
 * 实现此接口的bean不能作为普通bean使用
 * FactoryBean以bean样式定义，但是为bean引用公开的对象({@link getObject()})始终是它创建的对象。
 *
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 *
 * factorybean可以支持单例和原型，可以根据需求创建对象，也可以在启动时立即创建对象。
 * {@link SmartFactoryBean}接口允许暴露更多细粒度的行为元数据。
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 *
 * 这个接口在框架内部被大量使用，它也可以用于定制组件;但是，这只适用于基础架构代码。
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in the
 * bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access to
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 *
 * {@code FactoryBean}是一个编程契约。实现不应该依赖于注释驱动的注入或其他反射工具
 * {@link getObject()}调用可能会在引导过程的早期到达，甚至在任何后处理器设置之前。如果您需要访问其他bean，请实现{@link BeanFactoryAware}并以编程方式获取它们。
 *
 * <p><b>The container is only responsible for managing the lifecycle of the FactoryBean
 * instance, not the lifecycle of the objects created by the FactoryBean.</b> Therefore,
 * a destroy method on an exposed bean object (such as {@link java.io.Closeable#close()}
 * will <i>not</i> be called automatically. Instead, a FactoryBean should implement
 * {@link DisposableBean} and delegate any such close call to the underlying object.
 *
 *
 * 容器只负责管理FactoryBean实例的生命周期，而不负责管理FactoryBean创建的对象的生命周期
 * 因此，一个公开的bean对象上的destroy方法(例如{@link java.io.Closeableclose()}将被自动调用<i>不<i>。
 * 相反，FactoryBean应该实现{@link DisposableBean}，并将任何类似的调用委托给底层对象。
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).
 *
 * 最后，FactoryBean对象参与包含bean创建的BeanFactory的同步。除了用于FactoryBean本身(或类似的)内延迟初始化的目的外，通常不需要内部同步。
